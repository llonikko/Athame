Athame
------
Athame is a program for downloading music from music streaming and sharing services.
It is intended for educational and private use only, and **not** as a tool for pirating and distributing music.
Above all else, remember that the artists and studios put a lot of work into making music -- if you can, purchase
music directly from the artist as more money goes to them.

Since I am also caught up with other things I can't devote all my time to fixing and improving Athame. Right now it is
just a very buggy, basic tool which I hope will either be improved upon in the future, or be contributed to.
